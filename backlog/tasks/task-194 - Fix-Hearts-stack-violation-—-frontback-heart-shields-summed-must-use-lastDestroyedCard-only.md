## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## Problem

`engine/src/combat.ts:183` computes `heartShield = frontHeartShield + backHeartShield`, summing both front and back heart values when both are destroyed in the same attack. RULES.md §9.3 and §19 (hard invariants) explicitly state: "Hearts do not stack."

The spec defines the heart shield as: if `lastDestroyedCard.suit == ♥` at the Card→Player boundary, reduce remaining by that card's value. Only the **last destroyed card** before the player boundary counts.

Additionally, `frontHeartShield` is gated on `!newBf[column + ctx.columns]` (no back card), which means if both front Heart and back card are destroyed, the front Heart shield is silently dropped — a second divergence from the `lastDestroyedCard` semantic.

## Evidence

- `combat.ts:183`: `const heartShield = frontHeartShield + backHeartShield`
- `combat.ts:110-113`: `frontHeartShield` only set when no back card exists
- RULES.md §9.3, §19: "Hearts do not stack" — hard invariant

## Expected behavior

Only the last card destroyed in the column before the player boundary applies a heart shield. This is always the back card if it is a Heart and is destroyed, or the front card if no back card exists and the front card is a Heart and is destroyed. The front card's heart value must NOT be added when the back card is also destroyed.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Two Hearts in same column both destroyed: only last-destroyed Heart value shields LP, not sum of both
- [ ] #2 Front Heart destroyed, no back card: front Heart shields LP correctly
- [ ] #3 Back Heart destroyed (front was not Heart): back Heart shields LP correctly
- [ ] #4 Front Heart destroyed, back non-Heart also destroyed: no heart shield applied
- [ ] #5 Hearts-do-not-stack invariant verified by dedicated test
- [ ] #6 All existing combat tests still pass
